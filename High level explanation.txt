First, many static variables are declared in order for tracking certain statistics, I used ArrayLists that could dynamically adjust
to different pcap files with different numbers of flows if need be. 

The readPacktsFromFile function, takes the pcap file given, and returns an arraylist of byte[], which are the bytecode of the network communications

The packInfo function, then takes this newly acquired information and goes into the nitty gritty of it,
analyzing each byte for its pertinant information and bitshifting when necessary to acquire the proper information,
it returns a 2d array of longs, which are a list of the packets each with its own list of the pertinant information,
the format is table[packetNumber][n] where n = {0:seq 1:ack 2:rwind 3:sendPort 4:receivePort}

Then outputInfo is called, which is a void function, only outputting all the information in a readable format within the console.
